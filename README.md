# SnakeGame
Snake Game in Java

# Intro
In the Snake game I've developed in Java, you control a snake that slithers around a grid. I've made it so that you can change the direction the snake moves in, but it's always moving forward. The goal is to gobble up food that randomly appears on the grid, making the snake grow longer each time you eat. But watch out! If the snake collides with itself or the edges of the grid, it's game over. Your job is to keep the snake alive and thriving, racking up as many points as you can before it's game over.

# How to run?

4. Horrey!! Enjoy the game..!!
